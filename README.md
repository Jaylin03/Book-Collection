# Book Collections
This project is a simple beginner website containing information of all of the books I own. This is my **first** project onmy journey to full stack web development :blush:. I thought it best to begin with a topic close to home.

I will only be using HTML and CSS. While I learned the languages in high school, I reaize I need to take a step back in order to move farther forward.
